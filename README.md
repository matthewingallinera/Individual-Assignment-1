This is the README for Individual-Assignment-1 by Matthew Ingallinera. This project contains two get requests /hello which is just a hello statement and /lyrics which uses the lyrics.ovh api to get the lyrics of a song 
(in this specific example it gives the lyrics to the John Mayer song Wildfire) when the get request is used.
